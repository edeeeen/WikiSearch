# WikiSearch

A very quick and dirty FFXIV plugin made in about 20 mins that searches the wiki using `/wiki` and also adds a menu when you right click and item to search for it.  

This is all pretty much just a stack overflow response, [SamplePlugin](https://github.com/goatcorp/SamplePlugin), and [MarketBoardPlugin](https://github.com/fmauNeko/MarketBoardPlugin) for the context menu because I have very little clue what I'm doing when it comes to making plugins.
